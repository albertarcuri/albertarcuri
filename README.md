## About Me

I’m a full-stack developer with 10+ years of experience in building web applications. I specialize in back-end development with Ruby on Rails and Elixir (Phoenix Framework), as well as JavaScript (React, Vue.js) for front-end development. I also have extensive experience with AWS, using services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS to manage and deploy scalable applications.

I’m skilled in developing complete solutions, from designing responsive user interfaces to building reliable back-end systems. I have hands-on experience with Docker for containerization and CI/CD pipelines for automating deployments. I also use tools like Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure.
